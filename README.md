# Objective
Universities are located all around the world. Due to the number of options available, determining the best university can take time and effort. They are ranked according to many factors, such as research, teaching practices, alums, and employer reputation, to name a few. There are numerous national and international ranking systems. These ranking systems often have differing views on which universities are the best. This analysis will examine a global university ranking, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR).

I was asked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
